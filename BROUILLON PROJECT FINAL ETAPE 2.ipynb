    "Other the years Gun control was and is a politically mitigate  topic, with people having different strong opinion on it. Whever we are talking about Homicide ,Suicide or mass shooting the shooters profile are diverse, some are young, some have mental illness or some have gun experience and training, which make difficult to target a specific category of massive gun shooter in order to stop them. Moreover whever they are victim themselves  or someone close to them, or shooter young are extremely affected by this gun violence ,Among the world's wealthy nations, the United States accounts for 91 percent of all firearm deaths of children younger than 15(The Wshington post),with a majority of mass shooting occurring in school and university, places where youth are supposed to be safe. Thus, this liberty of having a gun in the US can create a complete disequilibrium in the life of US citizen, and must be a subject to look at carefully.\n",

    "The results of this research would first able authorities to better targeted who are susceptible to use their gun in a wrong way ,for instance we could create test that they have to succeed before being able to buy a gun. Furthermore, analyzing these data can raise  awareness to different level; awareness of the government in order to control this liberty and the right of the gun control, awareness that things must change, that for the youth it is an unhealthy way of being raised. The result can also be implemented in the real world in order to find solution for the youth to be less affected by this phenomenon."
